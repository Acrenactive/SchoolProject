## Welcome to My School Project (Homeworks)

Hey! i will put all my homework files here from my C++ Class .
I made this github pages just to have it like a library and so other beginner can watch this page and maybe learn something i do.


### Beginner

I am a beginner in C++ but i am really intresting to learning me more about that language

### Guide

I will put file here so i can explain on my own way how some of the code work like Variables and types.
* (Psst... i am still amateur in C++ so my explaining how things work is that way it worked for me.)
